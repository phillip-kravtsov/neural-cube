# neural-cube
3x3 rubik's cube solver that uses neural nets as move predictors and heuristics
to implement the kociemba phase-based cube solving algorithm.
No support for user input / scrambles as of now - random scrambles and solves.
Run search.py with argument "solve" to generate a scramble and solve it.
There are some extra models in the folder that are currently unused.
